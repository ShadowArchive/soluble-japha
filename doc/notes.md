### Status

Client API can be considered stable. 

Although semantic versioning will only be respected from v1.0.0 release, only minor modifications to the API will be considered at that point.

At time of writing this document (Jul 16), the version 0.11.6 passes 57 unit tests and 582 assertions 
for a coverage of 58%. *(The low degree of coverage is mainly due to a lot of obsolete code in 
the pjb driver code that is still to be removed once reaching v1).*

### Changelog

Versions and changelog are documented on the <a href="https://github.com/belgattitude/soluble-japha/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog page</a>

### Differences with the legacy Java.inc client.

The original `Java.inc` client has been completely refactored to fit current trends modern in PHP practices (2016).

- New API (not backward compatible)

    All global functions have been removed (`java_*`) in favour of a more object oriented approach. 
    By doing so, the new API breaks compatibility with existing code (see the 
    [legacy compatibility guide](./pjb62_compatibility.md) if you have code written against 
    the `Java.inc` original client), but offers the possibility to rely on different driver implementations 
    without breaking your code.

- PHP version and ecosystem

    - PHP7, HHVM ready (PHP 5.5+ supported).
    - Installable with composer
    - Compliant with latests standards: PSR-2, PSR-3, PSR-4

- Enhancements    
    
    - Namespaces introduced everywhere. 
    - Removed global namespace pollution (java_* functions)
    - Removed global variables, functions and unscoped statics.
    - No more get_last_exception... (All exceptions are thrown with reference to context)
    - Autoloading performance (no more one big class, psr4 autoloader is used, less memory)
    - Removed long time deprecated features in Java.inc
    - By design, no more allow_url_fopen needed.
    
- Fixes
    
    - All notices, warnings have been removed
    - Some minor bugs found thanks to the unit tests suite

- Testing
   
    - All code is tested (phpunit, travis), analyzed (scrunitizer)
